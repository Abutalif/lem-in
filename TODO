Dual CMD. One for CLI. One for web.

Curent process:
Working with a solver. The idea is to add rooms to a path, only if it reaches end.

An interesting case. Suppose my start is connected to single room. This room is then branches out to two other rooms, each leading to the end room.
The path through the first branch is shorter.
So, as the ants start moving, it might be worthwile to start sending ants through a second branch.

So the question is how to find all the paths?

I should also keep in mind that my links between rooms is bidirectional.
In that case, can the bidirectionality be used for better paths?? Yes.
The question is then, how should I limit the number of path, so my ants won't be running in circles??

Long story short, I have to learn Dijkstra algorithm.
