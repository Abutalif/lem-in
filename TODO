1. Dual CMD. One for CLI. One for web. 

2. Check all endcases:
    - No end
    - No start
    - No connection

3. See Edmondsâ€“Karp algorithm and Dinic's algorithm.

4. Create a folder in usecases named pathfinders, which contain packages named after used algorythm.
    - Each file defines a struct that fits to the pathFinder interface.
    - The pathfinder file defines the interface for pathFinders. It also manages which algorithm to chose, based on the graph provided.
5. Seems my builder cannot register all connections. Should check it.

6. When adding web interface, consider creating two methods of creating anthill: from text. And drawing.
    The easiest way would be making the frontend able to construct an input text simmilar CLI input text.

7. Bug Found for simple pathfinder: If the start is adjacent to the end, the path cannot be found.

Future improvement:
Make each node of the path have not a single continuation, but several.
And then, traversing ants can choose, which path to go based on if there is no ant.
