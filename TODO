1. Dual CMD. One for CLI. One for web. 
2. Builder must check if start and end are not adjacent (not sure about that)
3. Check all endcases:
    - No end
    - No start
    - No connection
4. See Edmondsâ€“Karp algorithm and Dinic's algorithm.
5. Create a folder in usecases named pathfinders, which contain packages named after used algorythm.
    - Each file defines a struct that fits to the pathFinder interface.
    - The pathfinder file defines the interface for pathFinders. It also manages which algorithm to chose, based on the graph provided.
6. Seems my builder cannot register all connections. Should check it.
