1. Dual CMD. One for CLI. One for web. 

2. Check all endcases:
    - No end [DONE]
    - No start [DONE]
    - No connection [DONE]
    - Duplicating rooms [DONE]

3. See Edmondsâ€“Karp algorithm and Dinic's algorithm.

4. Create a folder in usecases named pathfinders, which contain packages named after used algorythm.
    - Each file defines a struct that fits to the pathFinder interface.
    - The pathfinder file defines the interface for pathFinders. It also manages which algorithm to chose, based on the graph provided.

5. Seems my builder cannot register all connections. Should check it. [DONE]

6. When adding web interface, consider creating two methods of creating anthill: from text. And drawing.
    The easiest way would be making the frontend able to construct an input text simmilar to CLI input text.
                                    ---or---
    My builder will recieve only data needed to build a room, tunnel and anthill. The interface should just fit incoming data to it.
    No matter what are the incoming things.

7. Gotta add all tests from intra and audit.

8. Standartize error message. Every message should start with "ERROR: invalid data format,"


Future improvement:
Make each node of the path have not a single continuation, but several.
And then, traversing ants can choose, which path to go based on if there is (or will be) no ant.
