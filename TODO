Solving:
    how should I solve the puzzle??

Dual CMD:
    i might create two separate mains



I was thinking about making the most naive solution.
Turns out I am trying to implement Edmund-Karps, which is probably far from naive solution.
Now what I can do is come up for some kind of algorythm. The most naive one.
Suppose I have a start room. I will visit its neighbors. And then Visit its neighbors' neighbors.
So at the end I should have a list of references that are ordered rooms from start to end.
Right now I assume for a naive solution, a single shortest path should be found,
and then appended to a solution.



I am a bit unsure about structure of my entites for solution.
Right now my solution is just a list of Path that lead from start to end.
To be honest, I think its an overkill, that is it just makes my code bloated.
What really a solution must represent is distribution of ants on each valid path.
So the most efficent travelsal is obtained. Should my Paths look like linked list???
At the end of the day, my solutions should represent a set of instructions on how ants must move.

Ok. I think its enough for today.
