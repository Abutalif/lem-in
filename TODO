Reading:
    how to read:
        - comments,
        - start,
        - end
    how and when to change readState?
        from readRooms to read Tunnels



Thoughts:
they only way to see if to change read mode is to check fromat. But I also know that read state changes sequentally: ants-> rooms-> connections.
I could have added read regexp for each case and then match its case
